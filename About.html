  <h1><B>Welcome to the Church of Spongebob!</B></h1> 
  <P>The Church of Spongebob is a joke that should not be taken seriously ever. Most of the content on the website are references to the television show. I hope that this doesn't offend anyone in anyway, but I needed something to make this assignment fun so I don't break my keyboard after getting code wrong for an hour. For even more information please see History. </P> 
 <P>The Church of Spongebob offers great benefits such as:</P>
    <P>· A Church you can enjoy in your own home - no special building to go to.</P>
    <P>· A Church that presents it's precepts and spiritual instruction in an easily accessible format.</P>
   <P>· <strike>A Church that doesn't want your money and only wants you to be happy.</strike></P>
    <P>· A Church that realizes that simple things, like having fun, using your imagination, and enjoying what you do, are important in life.</P>
    <P>· A Chruch that is totally not a cult. </P>
 So ask yourself are <i>you</i> ready to sign up?
 All it takes to join is a donation of at least $20 to the church
