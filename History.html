The humble beginnings of the Church of SpongeBob started like many other great things; with two complete idiots. The ancient history of the church dates all the way back to November 27, 2016. It all started when I asked my friend who went off to California to become a computer science major how to make html code work. He was mostly completely useless, but did ask me what I was going to make the website about. Despite playing around with code for a while I never thought about what the website should be about. To figure out what to make the website about we played the holy game of “odds are” (A dare game wherein a person issues an outrageous dare to another person, the recipient of the dare must say 1 out of a certain number, demonstrating the likelihood that they will perform the dare. Then the darer and the daree must say a number through 1 and the certain number and if both participants say the same number, then the daree must perform the dare) I lost and decided to base 10% of my grade on a dare to make a website about the Church of SpongeBob. It was also on that day that the Church would no longer recognize 7 as a number and only a symbol of misfortune. Thus, this grand <strike>cult</strike> Church was born!
